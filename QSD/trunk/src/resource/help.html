        Quick Sequence Diagram Editor is a tool for creating UML
        sequence diagrams from textual descriptions of objects and
        messages.
      </div>
      
<div class="para">
        It supports threads, actors, constructors, destructors, notes
        and fragments.
      </div>
      
<div class="para">
        The aim of the tool is to save you from lots of the stupid work
        that WYSIWYG applications require, by trading off not too much
        flexibility. It beats these applications by far when it comes to
        insert or remove objects and messages. This can be done by just
        inserting or removing a line of text, the tool will do all the
        rest.

</h1>

      
<div class="para">
        Among its features are:
        <ul>
          
<li>
            Automatic redrawing - The diagram changes as you type.
          </li>
          
<li>
            Syntax check - errors in the textual descriptions are
            highlighted and can thus easily be found.
          </li>
          
<li>
            Automatic completion - Object names can be guessed from a
            prefix (using the TAB key).
          </li>
          
<li>
            Export - Diagrams can be exported in virtually any format,
            whether vector or pixel based.
          </li>
          
<li>Zoom - Diagrams can be viewed in any zoom factor.</li>
          
<li>
            View-text-correspondence - When you enter a message, the
            diagram view scrolls to where the corresponding arrow is to
            be seen. When you click an arrow, the cursor moves to the
            line where the message corresponding to the arrow is
            specified.
          </li>
          
<li>
            Server mode - Diagram specifications generated by another
            tool can be transmitted through a socket and displayed in
            real-time.
          </li>
          
<li>
            Links - You can create links to other diagrams. This feature
            can be used for providing easy access to a finer view onto
            something from which a more coarse-grained diagram abstracts
            away.

          may become active for the last time and, for example, send
          some destroy messages to other objects. But after this last

          Actors can only send and receive asynchronous messages that
          return immediately. An asynchronous message will be generated
          that is sent back to the actor when the activity that was
          started by his message is finished. If &lt;answer&gt; is empty
          and "show answers to actors" is set to 0 in the

<div class="para">
          If an actor sends a message to an ordinary object, all
          activities will be finished before. An actor should typically
          send the first message of the diagram, but this is not
          necessary, sequences without even a single actor are still

<div class="para">
          Second, a sequence of messages can be declared to be a

          surrounding those messages. It has a type (for example: alt,
          cond, or opt), appearing in the top-left corner, and a text,
          appearing in square brackets at the top of the frame. The text
          typically represents a condition. For example:

[c:&lt;type&gt; &lt;text&gt;]
  foo:bar.message_1
  foo:bar.message_2

<div class="para">
          Fragments can be slightly abused: if you write [c
          &lt;text&gt;] (without the colon), all of the text will appear
          in the small box in the top left corner.
        </div>
        
<div class="para">

          The effect is that a dashed line is drawn from the left to the

<a name="how.annotations.notes">Notes</a>

<div class="para">
          Third, there are notes. These appear in a box resembling a
          piece of paper that is arranged to the right of a lifeline.
          Notes are a part of the message section. The top of the box is
          where an arrow belonging to a message specified at the same
          position in the text would appear. The syntax is similar to a
          here-document delimited by an asterisk followed by a number
          (without the &lt;&lt;).

<div class="para">
          &lt;name&gt; is the name of the lifeline such that the note is
          to the right of it. &lt;num&gt; is the unique number
          identifying the note. You can refer to this number anywhere in
          the code - even before the note - in order to associate the
          note to messages or lifelines. For this you add one of the
          following prefixes to a message or the name of a lifeline:
          <ul>
            
<li>
              (&lt;num&gt;). A line will be drawn from the note box with
              the number &lt;num&gt; to the message arrow or to the
              current vertical position of the lifeline.
            </li>
            
<li>
              (&lt;num&gt;,&lt;anum&gt;). This can only be the prefix of
              a message. The effect is the same as above, if &lt;num&gt;
              is not empty. Additionally, there will be a line drawn
              from the note box &lt;anum&gt; to the arrow belonging to
              the answer of the message
            </li>
          
</ul>
          Example:
        </div>
        
<pre>
*5 foo
  foo calls bar's wait method
*5
*6 foo
  foo is waiting for bar
*6
*7 foo
  bar is ready
*7

(5,7)foo:ready=bar.wait()
(6)foo
  bar:do something
(6)foo
bar:do something more
        </pre>
        
<div class="para">
          If you use a "+" instead of a "*", the
          note box will consume as much vertical space as it needs and
          there will not be any message arrow or other note box beside
          it. When using "*", the note box will consume its
          own vertical space only if it is followed by a message arrow
          that is adjacent to one its both neighbour lifelines.

<div class="para">
          There are no direct associations between notes and objects. If
          one wishes to note something concerning an object or actor,
          she or he should specify a note belonging to the corresponding
          lifeline before any message has been specified.

            A single-lined note that starts with "link:" is
            interpreted as a link to another sequence diagram. The part
            of the line that follows is a URI (see
            <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt">
              RFC 3986
            </a>
            ) of an sd file. If the URI is relative, it is resolved
            against the location of the file of the current diagram.
            Example:
          </div>
          
<pre>
#BEGIN of file "a.sd"
a:A

*1 a
link:b.sd
*1 a
#END
          </pre>
          
<pre>
#BEGIN of file "b.sd",
#located in the same directory as "a.sd"
b:B
#END
          </pre>
          
<div class="para">
            When the note in the "a.sd" diagram is clicked,
            "b.sd" will be opened.
          </div>
          
<div class="para">
            There is a problem when the characters behind
            "link:" contain spaces. This is a bad URI syntax.
            Spaces must be replaced by "%20". Especially on
            Windows, where directory names with spaces are far from
            being exceptional - for instance "Program Files" -
            one may easily run into this problem when trying to specify
            absolute paths.
          </div>
          
<div class="para">
            Those characters are interpreted as a URI for the sake of
            platform independence. This means that even on the Windows
            platform, "/" is to be used as a separator in a
            path to a file. Absolute path names should start with
            "file:/".

<div class="para">
        When you have entered a (non-empty) prefix of a name of an

        Ctrl-Shift-Space (like in some IDEs) for completing the name
        automatically or for browsing through (via successive
        keystrokes) all object names with that prefix.
      </div>
      
<div class="para">
        If there is whitespace or a delimiter (one of {'&gt;', ':',
        '='}) to the left of the cursor, the TAB key will behave
        normally, so you can still use it for indentations.

<a name="how.autoredraw">Automatic redrawing</a>
</h2>
      
<div class="para">
        By default, a new diagram is generated from your text almost as

        leave the diagram unchanged.
      </div>
      
<div class="para">
        This is a suitable behaviour for a standalone PC that is
        reasonably well equipped. In some situtations, however,
        especially when Quick Sequence Diagram Editor acts as a remote X
        client, it can be a nuisance. So you may disable automatic
        redrawing in the "View" menu. When it is disabled,
        only a syntax/semantic check is performed. To see a new diagram,
        you must click "Redraw" or type F5.
      </div>
      
<div class="para">
        The time that passes between a change of text and a redrawing or
        a syntax/semantic check can also be adjusted in the
        configuration dialog (see "Redraw/syntax check
        delay"). It may be desirable to have two different delays
        (one for redrawing, one for the check), but this feature is not
        (yet?) implemented.

<div class="para">
      To use this function, select "Start/stop RT server" in

<li>
          The first line is interpreted as the name of a new tab to be
          opened.

          The remaining lines are entered into the text area of the new
