<h1>
<a name="threads">Multithreading</a>
</h1>
    
<div class="para">
      Multithreading support is an advanced feature that is available
      since version 2.2. If you are not interested, you can completely
      ignore it.
    </div>
    
<div class="para">
      If you are interested, you may enable it in the
      "Threads" menu.
    </div>
    
<div class="para">
      When multithreading is enabled, you can create diagrams that model
      arbitarily many sequences running in parallel, not just a single
      one. The sequences can (at your option) be distinguished by the
      colours of their corresponding lifelines. There is still no real
      parallelism, as the messages must be specified in some order. This
      order can be interpreted as one of many possible
      interleavings
      of the threads. A single-processor system would execute them in a
      similar way.
    </div>
  
  
<h1>
<a name="spec">Specifying diagrams with multiple threads</a>
</h1>
    
<div class="para">
      Specifying a multithreaded diagram is only slightly harder than
      specifying a diagram with a single thread.
    </div>
    
<h2>
<a name="spec.spawn">Spawning threads</a>
</h2>
      
<div class="para">
        A newly spawned thread can be distinguished from older threads
        by the colour of its corresponding lifelines. If you spawn too
        many threads, colours may be repeated. Threads have successive
        numbers, starting with 0.
      </div>
      
<h3>
<a name="spec.spawn.static">Statically spawned threads</a>
</h3>
        
<div class="para">
          Objects that have been declared with the "t" flag
          set, for example:
        </div>
        
<pre>o:Object[t]</pre>
        
<div class="para">
          have their own (statically spawned) thread. The first thing
          that happens on this thread must be a message sent by the
          corresponding object.
        </div>
        
<div class="para">
          If there is no object with a "t" flag, there is a
          single thread nonetheless. It starts executing when the first
          message is sent by an object.

<h3>
<a name="spec.spawn.dynamic">Dynamically spawned threads</a>
</h3>
        
<div class="para">
          As a rule, a message sent by an actor to an object
          (dynamically) spawns a new thread.
        </div>
        
<div class="para">
          So do messages sent to "active objects". An object
          can be declared to be active by setting the
          <tt>v</tt>
          flag. Example:
        </div>
        
<pre>worker:BackgroundWorker[v]</pre>
        
<div class="para">
          Messages sent and received by ordinary objects may also spawn
          new threads. In order to specify that such a message is
          spawning, use a colon followed by a "&gt;" to
          separate the caller from the message. Example:
        </div>
        
<pre>object:&gt;bar.foo()</pre>
        
<div class="para">
          This means that
          <tt>object</tt>
          spawns a new thread and the first thing this new thread does
          is executing the
          <tt>foo</tt>
          method of the
          <tt>bar</tt>
          object.
        </div>
        
<div class="para">
          Note that you cannot specify answers to messages that spawn
          threads. If an object running on a new thread wants to
          communicate with the spawning object, it must explicitly send
          a message.
        </div>
      
      
<h3>
<a name="spec.spawn.broadcast">Broadcast messages</a>
</h3>
        
<div class="para">
          A message can have more than one callee, specified in set
          notation. In this case, it is a broadcast message. Example:
        </div>
        
<pre>caller:{callee1,callee2,callee3}.broadcast</pre>
        
<div class="para">
          A callee may not occur more than once in the callee set, the
          caller may not occur at all in there. The effect of a
          broadcast message is that a new thread is spawned for each
          callee.
        </div>
        
<div class="para">
          It is currently not possible to define mnemonics for objects
          that are activated by a broadcast message.
        </div>
      

    
    
<h2>
<a name="spec.thread">Specifying the thread where an activity occurs</a>
</h2>
      
<div class="para">
        When more than one thread is used, we need to be able to tell on
        which of the threads a message occurs. So the level of a caller
        (specified in square brackets) may be followed by the number of
        the thread, where level and thread are separated by a comma.
        Example:
      </div>
      
<pre>object[0,3]:bar.foo()</pre>
      
<div class="para">
        This means that
        <tt>object</tt>
        is sending a
        <tt>foo()</tt>
        message to
        <tt>bar</tt>
        on the thread number 3.
      </div>
      
<div class="para">
        If an object is used by a single thread only, the number of the
        thread can be omitted. If there is more than one thread using an
        object and the thread number is omitted, the editor assumes that
        the message is to be sent on the same thread as the most recent
        message. If you spawn a new thread, the next message will, if
        not otherwise specified, be sent on that new thread. It is also
        possible to omit the level and only specify the thread, so
        <tt>object[,3]:bar.foo()</tt>
        is equivalent to the example above, as 0 is the default level.
      </div>
      
<div class="para">
        You can also use a mnemonic between square brackets. When a
        mnemonic is defined for an object, the mnemonic determines both
        the level and the thread number.
      </div>
      
<div class="para">
        Thread numbers can be made visible at your option (see the
        "Threads" menu): They are shown at the top of the
        active lifelines.
      </div>
    
    
<h2>
<a name="spec.return">Instant return</a>
</h2>
      
<div class="para">
        Normally, the focus of a thread's activity stays on the object
        that has received the most recent message, unless the thread is
        stopped or another message is sent. Sometimes, however, it may
        seem inappropriate to have a thread's focus resting on an object
        for so long. In that case a message should be ended by an
        "&amp;". This means that the answer to the message
        will be sent immediately. Note that a message sent later cannot
        have the callee of the instantly returning message as a caller
        of course. Example:
      </div>
      
<pre>foo:bar.notify()&amp;</pre>
      
<div class="para">
        If a spawning message is suffixed with an "&amp;", the
        spawned thread does nothing and dies instantly. Such messages
        might be interpreted as asynchronous signals.
      </div>
    
    
<h2>
<a name="spec.stop">Stopping threads</a>
</h2>
      
<div class="para">
        Normally, a thread runs until the end of the diagram. But maybe
        you would like to model that it dies at some point. This is done
        by inserting a pseudo message of the form:
      </div>
      
<pre>object:stop</pre>
      
<div class="para">
        (where of course also a thread number may be specified).
        Stopping a thread may be necessary before an object can be
        destroyed, if the thread's activity does not return from the
        object otherwise. The text of the pseudo message (i. e.
        "stop") will not appear on the diagram. The visible
        effect rather is that the corresponding lifeline ends at that
        point.
      </div>
    
    
<h2>
<a name="spec.flowreturn">Returning control flow</a>
</h2>

      
<div class="para">
        Before an object sends a message, a thread's control flow has to
        return to it, which implies that some answers pending on the
        thread might have to be sent. Sometimes one wants to manipulate
        the control flow like this without the need to send a new
        message, e. g. for representing that a certain set of actions is
        finished now or for simply doing some "clean-up". This
        can be done by inserting a pseudo message consisting of just an
        underscore:
      </div>

      
<pre>object:_</pre>

      
<div class="para">
        The effect is that enough pending answers will be sent such that
        "object"
        <em>could</em>
        send a message now on its current thread (again, a special
        thread number may be specified). The pseudo message does not
        appear on the diagram and there will be no extra space consumed
        (apart from the space needed for the answers).
